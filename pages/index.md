#### Frederick Cheng at the University of Waterloo

My research interest lies in the sustainable development of water resources by exploring the interaction between hydrological and biogeochemical processes across different scales. Topics of particular interest are: modelling groundwater-surface water interactions, ecohydrological modelling across scales, contaminant fate in watersheds.

##### Current Work

* Influence of anthropogenic stressors on the local and regional role of wetlands within the hydrological and nutrient cycles
* Scaling biogeochemical models from plot scales to catchments
* Parsimonious models connecting morphology, hydrology and biogeochemistry in lentic systems
* Modelling the dynamics of E2/E1 estrogen persistence in stream-hyporheic systems
* Climatic and anthropogenic controls of chloride transport at continental scales
